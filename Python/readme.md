These are the Python programs that run on the Beaglebone. 

These programs handle motor control systems and basic GPIO functions that do not relate to audio, such as analog data from the proximity detectors and input from the eQEP's on the Beaglebone. feedback.py is responsible for initial sound source detection, while position.py is used by the second two robots to obtain specific coordinates and headings.
