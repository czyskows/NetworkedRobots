# NetworkedRobots
These are files related to networked robotic sound source localization

This project runs on a Beaglebone/Bela Board (bela.io). The files in this repository consist of the basic motor control and feedback systems used in this project. There are also two Pure Data (puredata.info) patches running on the Bela - one for envelope detection and one for cross-correlation.
