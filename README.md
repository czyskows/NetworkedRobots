# NetworkedRobots
These are files related to networked robotic sound source localization

This project runs on a Beaglebone/Bela Board (bela.io). The files in this repository explain the functional operation of this project. The Python files handle basic motor control and GPIO functions. The Pure Data files deal with audio signal I/O. The Eagle files are the .brd layouts for the custom circuit boards required by this project.
